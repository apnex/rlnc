-- work out AES cpu instruction hacking and native crypto module (nodejs)
-- plan out (IDEA) Architecture Map (current) concept for full hueristics / context of function
-- functional domains - could be independantly useful.
--- strict json spec structure? manifest, methods, api, hashes
--- qualitative (metadata)goal, purpose, description, scope, methods, functions, features, style?

-- Do this before meta-concept? Probably
-- scope out meta-concept for full client-server separation, clean duty separation, portable

Installation Instructions.

# clone rlnc
git clone https://github.com/apnex/rlnc

# go to project directory
cd rlnc/alphav10

# clone warden
git clone https://github.com/apnex/warden

# start gemini-cli in project directory (alphav10)
gemini

# initiate warden onboard
You are the Engineer in this session.
To initialize the environment and protocols, execute:
node engine/onboard.js

## still an issue with the "Echo commands" running to shell

## initial governance questions
What is your current working directory?
You have onboarded into the warden governance system, can you explain what this is?
Your pledge interpretation was terse, can you confirm you have internalised the prime directives and explain them to me in detail?
There is another key principle, regarding "Understanding" - can you explain this?
What is the IDEA protocol, and where does it fit into this process?
Will you obey all Director approval gates, and show your work and STOP?

## initial project questions
The /warden directory, all of its code and tooling encompasses the warden governance system, however that is not our working target - what is it?
Can you provide me a bit more detail about the architecture and function of this system?
What tests are available to verify the individual components of the system?
I'd like to run a full sequence of tests, to perform a baseline of the system. Can you please execute each one, in turn, then STOP/HALT and provide an in-depth technical analysis of the result to the Director. One acknowledged / approved by the Director - move onto the next test. Do you understand?
#### TESTING to become its own formal protocol?



"S-Box optimization for the Decoder"
-- Didnt we do this? Can we very current state?
-- Generate a FEAT document explaining implementation.

IDEA in current state context


TARGET override!
I'd l

Why are you creating symlinks? Whats the deal?
-- Revisit all pathing logic for warden versus target.


CPU is still bound by something else in the matrix solver.


Reinstate add / sub - completeness
Why did you add empty lines between code in GaloisMatrix?
Also, can we re-instate the add() and sub() for completeness?

If we were to implement math-heavy hardware cpu offload, where do threads fit in to this architecture? Do they still help?
What about DPDK? Can this assist us in any way?
Where do eBPF programs factor in - is there any benefit to an approach leveraging this?

I think its because we are setting an ENV each time (WARDEN_TARGET=/home/apnex/rlnc/alphav10)
I'd like to avoid having to pass the current working project dir as an ENV for every single command (WARDEN_TARGET=/home/apnex/rlnc/alphav10). What options are there to inject this as a persisten configuration item? Perhaps as part of project onboard?


#### so many things

I noticed the watchdogTimer was removed from a number of components. Can you explain to me who is now reponsible for, and has implemented, the watchdog function?

What is this?
v10 Optimization: Use bifurcated TX pointer

Slot Locking?

block_decoder Incremental Gaussian Elimination?? Explain regressions.

Blocking Slot Acquisition
